# Malaria-Dataset-
This dataset is widely available on Kaggle. On this dataset I have performed data analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. I have created random forest model and calculated r2 score. I have also used KNN and Stochastic Gradient Decent, and calculated the confusion matrix with its results and the roc curve for the algorithms respectively.
